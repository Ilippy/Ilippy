## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## **About me**:
Programming, for me, is more than just a jobâ€”it's a form of creative self-expression. 
Through code, I can bring ideas to life, build something new, and solve real-world problems using logic and technology.

I value Python for its simplicity, flexibility, and clarity. An important aspect of work for me is connecting with others who share my passion for programming and technology.

In my free time, I enjoy roller skating, fitness, and swimming.
